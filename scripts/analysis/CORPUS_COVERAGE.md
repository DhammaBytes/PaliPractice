## SRS Calibration Notes

### Coverage Distribution

**Well-attested categories (>1,000 forms):**
- Nouns: Masc-a, Neut-a, Fem-ā, Fem-i, Masc-ant, Masc-i
- Verbs: All endings, all tenses, both voices

**Moderately attested (100-1,000 forms):**
- Nouns: Most other patterns
- Verbs: Reflexive voice combinations

**Sparse coverage (<100 forms):**
- Nouns: Masc-ū (98 forms, 5 lemmas)
- Verbs: Future + Reflexive (200 forms, 139 lemmas)

### Implications for SRS

1. **Pattern weighting**: Consider frequency-based weighting in SRS to ensure
   learners encounter common patterns more often initially.

2. **Rare pattern handling**: For patterns with fewer lemmas (e.g., Masc-ū with
   only 5 lemmas), the SRS may need to cycle through the same words more frequently.

3. **Voice balance**: Reflexive forms are ~22% of verb corpus. Consider whether
   to weight active forms higher in default practice or offer voice-specific modes.

4. **Tense distribution**: Future tense has notably fewer corpus forms (1,884)
   compared to other tenses (~3,300-3,800). This reflects actual usage patterns
   in Pali texts.

## Technical Notes

- Form counts include multiple ending variants for the same grammatical slot
- "Lemmas" count unique dictionary headwords with attested forms
- Forms with case=0 or number=0 (1,660 total) are special entries without
  standard grammatical classification and are excluded from practice
